# SC2_ai_project
 This project is used to test capabilities of machine learning in StarCraft II. Long-term goal of this project is to win versus a diamond-level player.
 
## Getting Started
To get this repo for your testing just type to your terminal

```
git clone git@github.com:juuusto/SC2_ai_project.git
```

### Prerequisites
Software needed:

* [python-sc2](https://github.com/Dentosal/python-sc2)
* on_end method from [daniel-kukiela](https://github.com/daniel-kukiela/python-sc2)
* [tensorflow-gpu](https://www.tensorflow.org/)
* [keras](https://keras.io/)
* [OpenCV](https://docs.opencv.org/3.0-beta/index.html)

### Usage
Running the ProtossAi.py will create a numpy file, which contains raw data. This file can be used in creating a neural network model, that hopefully increases the win percentage.
